# NFT Collaterized Loans
P2P NFT Collaterized Loans on Solana

## How Does It Work?

1) Borrower Locks NFT + Additional Collateral (In Stablecoins) 
2) Borrower Places an Order 
3) Lender Looks At The Orders
4) Selects The Order (Program Internally Transfers Money From Lender to Borrower)

5:
> If Borrower Pays Loan Amount + Interest Before Repayment Deadline, The Borrower Receives The Collaterals

> If Borrower Doesn't Pay Before Deadline, The Lender Gets Rights To Withdraw Borrower's Collateral
